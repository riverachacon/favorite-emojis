# My Top Emojis

practicing react, and components

This React project displays a list of my top emojis, their names, and meanings. It uses components to render each emoji entry and maps over an array of emoji objects to create the list.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main parts:

1. **App Component**: The main component that renders the title and the list of emojis.
2. **Entry Component**: A component that renders individual emoji entries.
3. **Emojipedia**: An array of emoji objects with their details.

## Components

### `App.js`

The `App` component is the main component that renders the title and a list of emoji entries using the `Entry` component.
